The 404 Not Found error is a HTTP standard response code indicating that the client was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested. This error typically alludes to the fact that the requested URL doesn't exist, but it could also be due to a server-side error. There are several ways to troubleshoot a 404 error:

1. Refresh the page: The easiest and quickest way to solve your problem. Sometimes, a page can be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance or other issues.

2. Check the URL: Make sure the URL input is correct because a change in any single character can lead to a '404 Not Found' error.

3. Clear your browser's cache and cookies: If you can access the website on another device, and the '404 Not Found' error only appears on a certain computer, the problem could be with your browser.

4. Contact the website: If nothing works, you may need to contact the website administrators. They may have moved the page or the link you have may be outdated.

5. Use a search engine: Use a search engine like Google to find the page you're looking for, it might have been moved and re-indexed by search engines.

In the context of website development, creating a user-friendly 404 error page can help navigate users who encounter this error to other useful parts of your website, minimizing user frustration.
