[{"role":"system","content":"\nUseful to know:\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Instructions:\n\n404: Not Found"},{"role":"user","content":"Specification:\n\nThe 404 Not Found error is a HTTP standard response code indicating that the client was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested. This error typically alludes to the fact that the requested URL doesn't exist, but it could also be due to a server-side error. There are several ways to troubleshoot a 404 error:\n\n1. Refresh the page: The easiest and quickest way to solve your problem. Sometimes, a page can be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance or other issues.\n\n2. Check the URL: Make sure the URL input is correct because a change in any single character can lead to a '404 Not Found' error.\n\n3. Clear your browser's cache and cookies: If you can access the website on another device, and the '404 Not Found' error only appears on a certain computer, the problem could be with your browser.\n\n4. Contact the website: If nothing works, you may need to contact the website administrators. They may have moved the page or the link you have may be outdated.\n\n5. Use a search engine: Use a search engine like Google to find the page you're looking for, it might have been moved and re-indexed by search engines.\n\nIn the context of website development, creating a user-friendly 404 error page can help navigate users who encounter this error to other useful parts of your website, minimizing user frustration."},{"role":"user","content":"Unit tests:\n\nStatus code 404 Not Found is an HTTP response status code that indicates that the server could not find the requested resource. This might be because the resource does not exist, or because the server is configured not to fulfill the request for that resource.\n\nWhile a 404 error is often associated with a broken link on a website, it could be a result of a variety of issues such as:\n\n1. The URL has been mistyped: If a user mistypes a URL, the server wont find the incorrect address as it doesn't exist.\n\n2. The website's files or resources have been moved or deleted: If a website administrator moves or deletes files and resources but fails to update the related URL, a 404 error will occur.\n\n3. The server is not functioning correctly: Even if the requested URL is correct, if the server is not functioning correctly or is having issues, a 404 error might be displayed.\n\nFollowing are some troubleshooting steps for a 404 error:\n\n- Refresh the page: A temporary issue with the website might cause a 404 error. Simple refreshing your browser might solve the problem.\n  \n- Double-check the URL: Ensure the spelling, capitalization, and punctuation in the URL are correct. Some servers are case sensitive.\n\n- Clear your browser's cache and cookies: If you've visited the page before and it was relocated, you might be viewing the cached version of the page.\n\n- Use a search engine: Use a search engine such as Google or Bing to find the correct URL, if it has been changed or updated.\n\n- Contact the website administrator: If none of the previous suggestions work, contact the site administrator, they should be able to tell you if the page you're looking for exists and provide you with the correct URL.

We define a test for an invalid page on a website which we expect to return a 404 error. \n\nThis test uses the `requests` library to send an HTTP request to a non-existing webpage in 'example.com'. The HTTP response is stored in the variable 'response'. The `status_code` attribute of the 'response' object should return 404, indicating that the requested URL was not found on the server.\n\nWith these test cases, we can verify and ensure that the server is responding with the right HTTP status codes for nonexisting pages."}]
