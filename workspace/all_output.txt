In software development, unit tests are specific pieces of code written to test the individual units of functionality of a software component.
Here's how to create a pseudo test case for a 404 error:

```python
import requests
import unittest

class Test404Page(unittest.TestCase):
  
  def test_invalid_page(self):
    response = requests.get('http://example.com/nonexistentpage')
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 404)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, we are using Python's built-in 'unittest' module to create a test case. We define a test for an invalid page on a website which we expect to return a 404 error. 

This test uses the `requests` library to send an HTTP request to a non-existing webpage in 'example.com'. The HTTP response is stored in the variable 'response'. The `status_code` attribute of the 'response' object should return 404, indicating that the requested URL was not found on the server.

With these test cases, we can verify and ensure that the server is responding with the right HTTP status codes for nonexisting pages.
